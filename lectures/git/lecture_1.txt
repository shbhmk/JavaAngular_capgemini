Git 
Version control System

For the First time
1. Create a repository in github and in Local folder with same name.
2. Open Gitbash.
3. git init
4. git add <File name with extension and path>
5. git branch -M main (there could be different branch for different job like main)
6. git remote add origin <Link of github repo>
7. git commit -m "first commit" (commit with message using -m)

optional steps only asked by the git-bash
1-1. git config --global user.email "shubhamseth25j00@gmail.com" (your email)
1-2. git config --global user.name "mrshubham2k" (git username here)

8. git push -u origin main (final push in the github)
9. If asked to login in git you can do it either by providing udername password or access token and again run step 8 command else you are good to go.











Points to remember*
-Git will not add any folder if it's empty.
-Folder name in you local system should be same as the Repo name.
